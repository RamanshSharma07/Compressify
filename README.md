Compressify

Android image compression & cropping app built with Kotlin and Jetpack Compose. Designed with Clean Architecture and MVVM, and powered by DataStore for persistent, user-friendly settings (themes, defaults). Smooth navigation with NavHost/NavController, MediaStore integration, robust permission handling, and a custom animated splash screen.

ðŸ§± Architecture

	â€¢	MVVM: ViewModel exposes immutable UI state + one-shot events
	â€¢	Unidirectional data flow: UI â†’ intent â†’ ViewModel â†’ state â†’ UI
	â€¢	Use cases encapsulate business rules (e.g., CompressImage, CropImage, GetImages)
	â€¢	Repository mediates between domain and platform APIs (MediaStore, file I/O)
